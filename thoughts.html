                    Recently, I answered a <a id='para-link' href='http://www.quora.com/JavaScript/What-are-some-limitations-of-JavaScript' target='_blank'>question</a> on Quora about the limitations of JavaScript. The language itself is extremely powerful and reasonably fast. I thought I would share my answer here.

                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very powerful language that runs on your web browser. The fact that it runs on your 'web browser', creates a lot of limitations. Even if there are multiple ways to work around these problems, they are largely based on extended libraries or sending server side calls. JavaScript, inherently does not have solutions to these problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cannot access web pages hosted on a different domain:</b> You cannot access files that belong to a different domain name using solely JavaScript. Its based on the Same origin policy. You can workaround this using HTML5's new feature "postMessage" interface or using server side scripts using AJAX calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cannot access databases:</b> JavaScript cannot access backend databases without a server side script. However, there are certain client side databases that you can access via JavaScript e.g. Local Storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cannot write to files on the server:</b> Just like the aforementioned limitation, you cannot directly write to a file on the server side without actually sending an AJAX request that runs a server side script to do that for you. However, its also a good thing at the same time that you cannot write your files to the server as it raises an additional security concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Depends a lot on the browser:</b> JavaScript depends a lot on the browser it runs on. Different browsers interpret JavaScript differently as the browsers have diverse JavaScript engines. Its always safer to test your code in all major browsers before pushing it to production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Inability to use local devices:</b> You cannot use most of your local devices with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Option to disable JavaScript:</b> A lot of people tend to disable JavaScript in their browsers due to various security reasons. Think about all the websites that are highly dependent on client side scripts. If the user disables JavaScript, the web app is broken and it can't run on the browser which not only creates a problem for the web app but also for the user who is trying to enjoy a service!
